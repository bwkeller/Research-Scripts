# BW Keller's Research Scripts#
This repo contains a bunch of small(ish) scripts that I have written to do my 
research.  Most of these things do very specific tasks, and thus will be of very
little use to anyone other than myself.  Some of them have some neat ideas I've
had, and so they might be good references.  What else do you people want from
me? :P

##File Descriptions##
* examine
This is my big go-to simulation analysis tool.  I use it for quickly looking at
simulation outputs from gasoline, to generate plots and things.  I also import
it into many of my other scripts to pull functions out of it into more specific
plotting/analysis scripts.
* plot_gaslog_energies.py
This is a quick little script for plotting the energy evolution of a simulation
based on the energies stored in the gasoline logfile.
* pynmovie.py
This is one of my favourite scripts, it takes a list of gasoline output files
and generates a nifty little movie showing the time evolution of the sim.
